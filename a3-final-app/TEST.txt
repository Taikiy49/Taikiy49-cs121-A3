originally, when we tested queries like iftekhar ahmed, we would get something like this

https://www.ics.uci.edu/~iftekha/ (Score: 560.5258)Summarize
https://www.ics.uci.edu/~iftekha/#currentcourse (Score: 560.5258)Summarize

https://www.ics.uci.edu/~iftekha/publication/on-the-limits-of-mutation-reduction-strategies/ (Score: 45.4480)Summarize

where a lot of the links that we had obtained had the same content. the only difference between the links were that some of them had different fragments
therefore, we had decided to normalize the links to address this issue.

then, we noticed that we had the same issue with other links that had different links but the same exact content with the same exact ranking
so instead, we have decided to look at each of the rankings, and only display the links if they have a different ranking from the previous.
For example, if a link had a score of 126.7821 placed at top 3, then the next ranked link (top 4) should not have the same ranking as the previous (126.7821)

now the links that we obtain from the queries on our search engine look nicer and more inclusive:

again, each of the links are unique and contain different rankings :D!
