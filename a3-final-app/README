in the main directory, run...
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

IF YOU NEED TO RECREATE THE INDEX FILE, RUN...
```
python m1.py
```
make sure inverted_index.json is in the a3-final-app directory. if its not, simply move it there

ONCE THATS DONE:
cd into the a3-final-app directory
then run...

```bash
cd a3-final-app
python a3.py
```

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NODEJS INSTALLED, if not you can download it on: https://nodejs.org/en
you can check your versions by running:
```bash
npm -v
node -v
```

then open a separate terminal, cd into the a3-final-app directory and run... (make sure both the py file and the react app is running at the same time for this to work)
TO AVOID ENCOUNTERING ANY ERRORS run these methods
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm install axios
npm start
```

you can now input queries into the search engine, as well as finding summaries for each of the documents!
