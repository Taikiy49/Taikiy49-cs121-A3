cd into the a3-final-app directory and run...

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

then run...
```bash
python a3.py
```

then open a separate terminal, cd into the a3-final-app directory and run... (make sure both the py file and the react app is running at the same time for this to work)
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

you can now input queries into the search engine, as well as finding summaries for each of the documents!
