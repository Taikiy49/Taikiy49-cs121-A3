how i created the react app
i had to clear the cache because i was running into some sort of issue creating the react app
btw to connect our m2 to our frontend, we're gonna have to build another py file that with more imports to 
to allow this to happen, we use python Flask


# how we created our react app
```
npx clear-npx-cache 
npx create-react-app a3-final
npm install axios
```
 
to run the react app, make sure you have nodejs installed! IF U DONT HAVE THIS, UR PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN!
for mac users you can use homebrew:
``` 
brew install node
```
for windows or mac users don't have homebrew you can download and install node.js from their website

# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
make sure you have two separate terminals open
make sure you are in the a3-final-app directory (cd into it if ur not)
one terminal should run:
```
python3 a3.py
```

the other terminal should run:
```
npm start
```
